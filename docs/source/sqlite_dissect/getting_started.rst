Getting Started
===================

System Requirements
+++++++++++++++++++
SQLite Dissect depends on Python 3.6+, with automated tests run against versions 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. It has
been tested on Windows, OSX, and Linux (Ubuntu) platforms.

SQLite Dissect versions up to and including 0.1.0 support Python 2.7 and can be downloaded from the
`GitHub releases page <https://github.com/dod-cyber-crime-center/sqlite-dissect/releases>`_.

To try to limit the need for dependencies, only one package is required for SQLite Dissect, which is the
`openpxl <https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ package that is used for exporting the results into Excel format.

Installation
+++++++++++++++++++
SQLite Dissect is available from `PyPi <https://pypi.org/project/sqlite-dissect/>`_ and can be installed by running:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install sqlite-dissect

Alternatively, binary installations (packaged through PyInstaller) can be downloaded and installed from the `GitHub Releases <https://github.com/dod-cyber-crime-center/sqlite-dissect/releases>`_ page.
