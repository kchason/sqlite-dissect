System Requirements

SQLite Dissect depends on Python 3.6+, with automated tests run against versions 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. It has
been tested on Windows, OSX, and Linux (Ubuntu) platforms.

To try to limit the need for dependencies, only one package is required for SQLite Dissect, which is the
`openpxl <https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ package that is used for exporting the results into Excel format.
